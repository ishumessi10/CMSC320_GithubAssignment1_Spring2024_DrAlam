Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

As a Computer Science major with a keen interest in pursuing machine learning in the future,
 I believe that CMSC320 would provide me with valuable knowledge and skills that align 
 perfectly with my academic and career aspirations. I want to do machine learning in the 
 future and this course offers a comprehensive understanding of data science concepts, 
 techniques, and tools, which are essential for working with large datasets and extracting 
 meaningful insights. By learning how to analyse and interpret data effectively, I aim to 
 develop a strong foundation in machine learning algorithms and methodologies, ultimately 
 preparing myself for future research and industry opportunities in this rapidly growing field. 
 Also, Ms. Fardina was teaching this course this semester, and she had really good reviews 
 about her teaching, so I was eager to take this course with CMSC 330 and CMSC 351.
